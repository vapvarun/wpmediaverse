/**
 * One-time activation of the baked-in preset licence key against the store.
 *
 * Update downloads are authorised by a preset key that must be activated once
 * per site. The activation is a remote POST to wbcomdesigns.com, so it must
 * never run on the owner's admin page load: the original code fired a blocking
 * wp_remote_post( timeout: 15 ) on EVERY admin_init until it succeeded, adding
 * up to 15s to every wp-admin page forever when the store was unreachable.
 *
 * The same class ships in every Wbcom free plugin (standard:
 * docs/standards/preset-licence-activation.md); only the names, the key and
 * the item id differ. Keep them in step.
 *
 * This class moves the call into a background single event, bounds the retries
 * so a firewalled host stops trying after a day, and — when it does give up —
 * shows the owner an admin notice explaining why with a Retry button, instead of
 * failing silently forever. It deliberately writes NO tracking-consent option:
 * usage tracking is the EDD SDK's own opt-in (default off, toggled by the owner
 * on the licence screen). Forcing it on here was consent the owner never gave.
